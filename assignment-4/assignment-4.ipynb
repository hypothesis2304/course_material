    "### Transfer Learning : \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that deep learning models are very data hungry. It is not always possible to collect and annotate millions of data for the task of our interest. Instead what we would like to do is transfer learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is a phenomena where we use the existing ConvNet model trained on very large dataset as our fixed feature extractor or as a initialization. We then tune this model to our task of concern. The major transfer learning scenarios are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### ConvNet as fixed feature extractor : \n",
    "\n",
    "We take an existing Convolutional Neural Network trained on ImageNet(contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories) dataset and remove the fully connected layers of the pretrained model. We then freeze the layers(don't update the weights) of the ConvNet. Finally, we add our custom fully connected layers after the feature extractor to train the model. In this model, note that the feature extractor(pretrained model) is frozen implies during training only our newly defined fully connected layers are updated and the feature extractor values are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Fine-tuning the ConvNet : \n",
    "\n",
    "The other strategy is to train the model as a whole. In finetuning, we not only replace and retrain the added layers with the new dataset but also we finetune the whole feature extractor with the new dataset. It means, the pretrained model is no more a fixed feature extractor, it is also adapted to the new dataset by updating the weights. Intuitively, it is better to assume the pretrained model as a good initialization rather than a fixed feature extractor. Depending on the size of available dataset, we either fine-tune all the layers of ConvNet or only some of the layer.\n",
    "> - If the datset is too small(<1000 samples) finetuning the whole model increases the chances of overfitting. <br>\n",
    "> - A medium sized datset, finetuning the whole model can be done but regularizing the model carefully will prevent it from overfitting. \n"
